  GameTitle: Spiny Flannel Society
  Version: 0.2.0
  Description: "A hybrid 3D platformer about translation, systems, and diversity.
    Neuroaffirming | Non-violent combat | Universal design as world law"
  Setting: "Spiny Flannel Society is a living settlement suspended in permanent
    wind currents above an Australian coastline. It is not a school\u2014it is a
    place people live.\n\nWindgap Academy is one precinct inside: a learning commons,
    workshop district, and navigation hub\u2014the Society\u2019s \u2018translation
    engine.\u2019"
  SpinyFlannelAxiom: "The original principle that celebrated diversity:\n\u2022 Multiple
    valid paths through spaces\n\u2022 Adaptive systems responding to individuals\n\u2022
    Signals maintaining integrity across interpretation\n\u2022 Environment supports
    people, not corrects them"
  TheDrift: "When rigid \u2018standard defaults\u2019 were adopted, the Axiom withdrew.
    The Drift is systemic bias made physical:\n\n\u2022 Distortions \u2014 Glitched
    rules (ramps retract if you pause)\n\u2022 Echo Forms \u2014 Social scripts given
    motion (coercive routines)\n\u2022 Noise Beasts \u2014 Sensory overload as weather"
  PlayerRole: "You are THE TRANSLATOR. You perceive \u2018Windprints\u2019\u2014how
    assumptions embed into space. Your mission: make the Society fit people again.\n\nCommunication
    modes (all equal outcomes):\n\u2022 Direct speech    \u2022 Scripted responses\n\u2022
    Icon-based       \u2022 Minimal speech"

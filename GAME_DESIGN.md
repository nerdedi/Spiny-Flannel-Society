# Spiny Flannel Society - Game Design Document

> **Indie 3D platformer | Calm edge aesthetic | Neuroaffirming | Non-violent symbolic combat | Universal design as world law**

*Updated: Windgap Academy is now a learning district inside Spiny Flannel Society.*

---

## 1. Executive Overview

**Spiny Flannel Society** is a living settlement suspended in a permanent wind current above an Australian coastline. It is not a school — it is a place people live. **Windgap Academy** is one precinct inside the Society: a learning commons, workshop district, and navigation hub.

When the Society adopted rigid "standard defaults" (one pace, one social script, one correct way), its operating principle — the **Spiny Flannel Axiom** — withdrew. The result is **"The Drift"**: spaces contradict themselves, signals corrupt, and pathways penalise difference.

Players are a **Translator** who can read hidden assumptions in systems and rewrite environments. Gameplay is a hybrid 3D platformer: flow traversal plus precision challenges, paired with non-violent symbolic combat where threats are misaligned patterns rather than creatures.

**Optional Electives** embed logic, literacy, numeracy, language, and digital literacy as physical puzzle platformer rooms, never gating the story.

### Core Promise

> A world that becomes coherent not by fixing individuals, but by redesigning society so many kinds of minds can thrive.

---

## 2. World Bible — Spiny Flannel Society

Spiny Flannel Society is built from **soft brutalist terraces** stitched with eccentric biodesign: sandstone ribs, eucalyptus-glass canopies, laneway signal alleys, and floating "umbel gardens" where bridges grow like plant stems.

Architecture responds to people — ramps bloom, platforms knit themselves, signage re-renders in multiple modalities — until the Drift forces everything toward a single "normal."

### Key Districts

| District | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Windgap Academy** | Learning commons, workshops, archives, simulation studios; the Society's "translation engine" |
| **The Veil Market** | Sheltered trading lane where information, tools, and favours exchange; signage drifts first |
| **Sandstone Quarter** | Foundation terraces carved into warm rock; the Society's charter stones live here |
| **The Umbel Gardens** | Suspended neighbourhoods held by clustered supports; community visible as structure |
| **The Smoke Margin** | Controlled-burn perimeter and repair yards; where obsolete rules are decommissioned |
| **The Reliquary Edge** | Seed bank vault and principle conservatory; preserves rare design laws and cultural practices |

### The Drift (What "Goes Wrong")

The Drift is not chaos; it is **systemic bias made physical**. When the Society prioritises standardisation, the environment begins to correct people instead of supporting them:

- A ramp retracts if you pause
- A door opens only if you speak the "expected" phrase
- Platform timing assumes one processing speed

**Drift Manifestations:**
- **Distortions** — Glitched rules
- **Echo Forms** — Social scripts given motion
- **Noise Beasts** — Sensory overload as weather

## 3. Character Bible

### The Translator (Player)

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Role** | Newcomer with the rare capacity to perceive "Windprints" — how assumptions embed into space |
| **Motivation** | Make the Society fit people again |
| **Dialogue** | Minimal; player chooses communication modes (direct, scripted, icons, minimal speech) with equal outcomes |
| **Gameplay Tie** | Windprint Rig (Cushion/Guard) and adaptive finale |

### DAZIE Vine (Mentor / Systems Ethicist)

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Role** | Resident of Spiny Flannel Society and orientation lead at Windgap Academy |
| **Represents** | Structure-as-care: rules should protect people from power |
| **Arc** | Recovering from the "good resident" script; learns to build systems that refuse coercion |
| **Gameplay Tie** | Introduces Guard Mode, Edge Claim, and consent gates |
| **Voice** | Calm, precise, non-patronising |

### June Corrow (Sensory Architect / Biodesign Maker)

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Role** | Designed the Society's quiet infrastructure (filter routes, rest pockets, multi-modal cues) |
| **Arc** | From quietly maintaining "unofficial" supports to reinstating them as defaults |
| **Gameplay Tie** | Unlocks Cushion upgrades, filtration mechanics, and Veil district traversal |
| **Voice** | Sparse, warm, incisive |

### Winton (Civic OS / System-Ghost)

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Role** | The Society's operating interface made audible |
| **Personality** | Blunt, ethically focused, occasionally dry |
| **Arc** | Stops enforcing harmful defaults and becomes a transparent audit voice |
| **Gameplay Tie** | Surfaces system states, powers design terminals, records player's Windprint for finale |

### Antagonistic Patterns

These are not villains — they are **embodied consequences of misdesign**:

| Pattern Type | Description | Resolution |
|--------------|-------------|------------|
| **Echo Forms** | Coercive social scripts given motion | Resolved through restoration verbs |
| **Distortions** | Broken rules manifested physically | Fixed through design terminals |
| **Noise Beasts** | Sensory overload storms | Calmed through environmental tuning |

---

## 4. Gameplay Design (Platformer First)

### Movement: Flow + Precision

| Move | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Triple Hop** | Short → Long → Float |
| **Air Dash** | Upgrades to double dash |
| **Wall Run/Kick** | Vertical traversal |
| **Grapple Thread** | Connect to Botanical Nodes |
| **Glide/Wind Surf** | Cross canopy lines |
| **Pulse Slam** | Interact with mechanisms |

Main routes emphasise **flow**; Electives provide **precision mastery** for players who want it.

### Windprint Rig (Signature System)

The Translator's core tool with two modes:

#### Cushion Mode
- Widens timing windows
- Spawns safe pockets
- Reduces clutter
- Slows hazards

#### Guard Mode
- Pins platform rhythms
- Stabilises jitter
- Creates consent gates
- Claims boundary edges

> **The Society becomes coherent when both are used: softness + protection.**

### Symbolic Non-Violent Combat

Combat is **pattern intervention**, not violence:

| Verb | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Pulse** | Clears/resets cycles |
| **Thread Lash** | Interrupts loops |
| **Radiant Hold** | Shields, creates safe footholds |
| **Edge Claim** | Pins a rhythm |
| **Re-tune** | Cleans signal corruption |

**Encounter Types:**
- Traversal combat arenas
- Chase corridors
- System debug rooms

### Optional Electives (Stealth Learning)

Electives are **optional challenge rooms** embedding educational content as physical puzzles:

| Subject | Mechanic Example |
|---------|------------------|
| **Logic** | IF/THEN tiles mid-run |
| **Literacy** | Decoding signage to reveal routes |
| **Numeracy** | Calibrating ratios to stabilise bridges |
| **Language** | Building sequences for multi-stage traversal |
| **Digital Literacy** | System debugging as navigation |

**Electives never gate story** — they reward lore, cosmetics, shortcuts, and Windprint perks.

### Accessibility & Universal Design (Canon)

Accessibility is a **world mechanic**, not a hidden settings menu:

- Sensory sliders
- Motion/brightness/audio layers
- Clutter reduction
- Readable UI
- Subtitle styles
- Communication modes
- No forced timers
- No hard fail states
- **Safe routes are main routes**

## 5. Narrative by Level (12 Chapters)

### Chapter 1: Bract Theory
*Location: Windgap Academy Atrium*

Windgap Academy's orientation atrium misreads residents: ramps bloom for some, retract for others. Ari shows the bract carvings—protection that looks like beauty. The Translator restores the first civic rule: **supports appear without proof**. The atrium shifts from 'you will fit' to 'you fit'.

### Chapter 2: Felt Memory
*Location: Archive Walk*

Felted walls recoil when you rush—architecture trained by years of masking. June reveals quiet routes were marked 'non-essential'. By reinstating buffers and rest pockets, the Society begins to acknowledge **overload as information, not misbehaviour**.

### Chapter 3: Rayless Form
*Location: Social Hall*

The Social Hall stages residents into roles. Spotlights create platforms only for 'performers'. The Translator proves value doesn't require showiness: they build pathways where **silence, icons, and direct speech are equal**. Echo Forms dissolve when the hall stops ranking expression.

### Chapter 4: Umbel Logic
*Location: Umbel Gardens*

Clustered neighbourhoods drift apart when a single node is excluded. Traversal shows community as structure. The Translator adds **translation layers** so the network can hold different speeds, senses, and communication styles without collapsing.

### Chapter 5: Tickshape Rule
*Location: Skybridges*

Skybridges anchored by V-marks rearrange unless boundaries are set. Ari reframes rules as protection from power. The Translator encodes **consent gates and fairness rails**; bridges stop coercing movement tempo and start responding to declared needs.

### Chapter 6: Smoke Signal
*Location: Smoke Margin*

At the Smoke Margin, the obsolete Correction Engine ('The Filter') still runs, nudging residents toward conformity. A chase through smoky corridors becomes a live debugging ritual. The Translator disables correction and **reclassifies difference as adaptation**; smoke clears into clean wind.

### Chapter 7: Afterrain Bloom
*Location: Rain Cliffs*

Rain returns over the cliffs. Platforms pulse like blossoms—timing can be tuned rather than endured. Ari and June disagree: rebuild fast or rebuild safe. The Translator sets **'safe path = main path'**, making follow-up care an actual civic default.

### Chapter 8: Sandstone Drift
*Location: Sandstone Quarter*

The original charter stones read 'Flexible by default'—scratched out by later amendments. Foundations literally slide under rigid assumptions. The Translator rewrites the bedrock rules so **multiple valid routes can exist** without the city tearing itself apart.

### Chapter 9: Eucalypt Veil
*Location: Eucalypt Canopy*

Under filtered eucalypt canopy, sensory filtration becomes navigation. June restores multi-modal cues (light, icon, sound) and predictable transitions. The Society's noise-beasts thin; **calm returns as an engineered property**, not a personal obligation.

### Chapter 10: Clonal Echo
*Location: Model Society Simulation*

A sterile 'model society' simulation demonstrates the fragility of uniformity: repeating rooms collapse when one resident deviates. The Translator breaks the loop by designing **plural routes**—proof that diversity increases resilience. The simulation re-renders in layered colour.

### Chapter 11: Edge Reliquary
*Location: Reliquary Edge*

A conservatory vault stores rare civic principles: support without proof, translation over correction, consent as structure, rest as legitimate. The Translator integrates these **'principle modules'** into the Windprint Rig for the final rewrite.

### Chapter 12: Refound Light
*Location: Windcore Tower*

Final ascent to the Windcore. A single massive Distortion—the Standardiser—attempts to reinstall old defaults. Using every verb, the Translator dismantles it by fixing its logic. In the finale, the player **composes new societal defaults**. Spiny Flannel Society stabilises into plural coherence.

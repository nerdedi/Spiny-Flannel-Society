# Spiny Flannel Society - Game Design Document

## Core Concept

Spiny Flannel Society is a living settlement suspended in a permanent wind current above an Australian coastline. This hybrid 3D platformer explores themes of systemic rigidity, diversity, and the power of translation and interpretation.

## Narrative Foundation

### The Spiny Flannel Axiom
The original guiding principle that celebrated diversity and fluidity in the Society. It allowed for:
- Multiple valid paths through spaces
- Adaptive systems that respond to individual approaches
- Signals that maintain integrity across interpretation
- Environments that embrace difference

### The Standard Defaults
When the Society adopted rigid "standard defaults" as its operating principle, it introduced:
- Fixed, inflexible rules
- One "correct" way to navigate
- Homogenized approaches to problems
- Rejection of alternative perspectives

### The Drift
The consequence of abandoning the Spiny Flannel Axiom. The Drift manifests as:
- **Contradictory Spaces**: Rooms and areas that change based on rigid adherence to defaults
- **Signal Corruption**: Communication and data that degrades when diversity is suppressed
- **Pathway Penalization**: Routes that become hostile to non-standard approaches

## Player Role: The Translator

The player embodies a Translator - someone who can:
- **Read Hidden Assumptions**: Identify the underlying biases in systems
- **Rewrite Environments**: Change how spaces interpret and respond to input
- **Decode Corrupted Signals**: Find meaning in degraded communications
- **Create Alternative Pathways**: Establish routes that honor difference

## Core Gameplay

### 3D Platformer Mechanics
- Precise jumping and movement through wind-swept suspended structures
- Wall-running and momentum-based traversal
- Environmental interaction and object manipulation

### Hybrid Elements
- **Environmental Hacking**: Modify space properties to create new paths
- **Assumption Reading**: Scan environments to reveal hidden constraints
- **Signal Restoration**: Piece together corrupted messages
- **System Rewriting**: Change fundamental rules of how areas behave

### Progression
Players gain new translation abilities that allow them to:
1. Read simpler assumptions (tutorial phase)
2. Rewrite basic environmental properties
3. Restore corrupted signals
4. Combine abilities to solve complex spatial puzzles
5. Challenge and rewrite the Standard Defaults themselves

## Game World

### Setting
A vertical city suspended by permanent wind currents:
- Multiple districts connected by wind bridges
- Architecture that shifts based on interpretation
- Weather patterns that reflect systemic corruption
- Australian coastal vistas visible far below

### Atmosphere
- Dreamlike but grounded
- Wind constant but varied
- Color palette shifts from rigid grays (Standard Defaults) to vibrant diversity (restored Axiom)
- Sound design emphasizes environmental response to player choices

## Victory Condition

Restore the Spiny Flannel Axiom by rewriting enough of the Society's core systems to accept diversity again, ending The Drift and stabilizing the settlement.
